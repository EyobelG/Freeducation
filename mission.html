        <h2>Our Mission: Unleashing Global Potential</h2>
    </div>
We believe that talent is universal, but opportunity is not. Our mission is to
dismantle the financial barriers that keep brilliant young minds from realizing 
their full potential. We are building a future where every motivated student, 
regardless of their family's wealth, has unrestricted access to a world-class education.
We don't just teach; we equip the next generation of innovators, leaders, and problem-solvers 
to shape a more equitable and prosperous world.
